### Flashing firmware
New released binaries can be flashed over USB. Plug the badge in and power on, open a serial connection the the badge's com port with a speed of 1200, this will force the badge to reset into boot select mode. Drag/drop the new uf2 firmware onto the drive and the badge will reboot the new code. 

If you have access, you can use a popsicle stick or other, preferabbly non conductive tool, to press the boot button while powering on the badge. This will mount the drive as well.
